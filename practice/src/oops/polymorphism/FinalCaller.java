        //        new circle()ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ
        //which method is to be called is dependent on the ðŸ‘† and this and it is called upcasting

//        Shapes cir ---> "Shapes" only says what is has access to. It has access to area()of its own class
//        but during run time it overrides and calls Circle's area()

//        now which area()method is called is dependent on object


//how does java decide which method to be called ---> it determines usinig "DYNAMIC METHOD DISPATCH"
//DYNAMIC METHOD DISPATCH ?
//        Its a mechanism in which a call to a overridden method is resolved at runtime, rather than at compile time
