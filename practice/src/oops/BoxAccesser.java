// weight (element that belongs to child class) cannot be accessed through box1.

//        new BoxChild(1,2,43, 5); weight was able to go into box1 but it cannot be accessed

//        BoxChild box2 = new BoxParent();//invalid
//as saidüëÜ whatever present here only elements of those class can be accessed

//‚≠ê‚≠ê CHILD CLASS CANNOT CREATE A PARENT CLASS but PARENT CLASS CAN CREATE CHILD CLASS(logically)
//here it doesnt allow that coz...
//to access something, (i.e weight) it must be initialized first
//and here BoxChild is referred as box2 but BoxChild is never initialized instead BoxParent is called
