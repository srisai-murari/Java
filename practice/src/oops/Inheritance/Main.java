        //twisted partüëáüëá

        BoxParent box1 = new BoxChild(1,2,43, 5); //works
//here  üëÜwhatever present here only elements of those class can be accessed
//so, here we have parent class hence we can only access to parent class elements like l,b,w,noAccess
// weight (element that belongs to child class) cannot be accessed through box1.

//        new BoxChild(1,2,43, 5); weight was able to go into box1, because BoxChild class has constructor with those many parameters
//        but it cannot be accessed
//        System.out.println(box1.weight);



//        BoxChild box2 = new BoxParent();//invalid
//as saidüëÜ whatever present here only elements of those class can be accessed
//so, as per that we should be able to access "weight" which is present in BoxChild, but no. why? üëá
//here it doesnt allow that coz...
//to access something present in BoxChild (i.e weight) then those elements must be initialized first
//and here BoxChild is referred as box2 but BoxChild is never initialized instead BoxParent is called as object reference
//weight is smth that never initialized rather (l,h,b) that are present in parent class are initialized
//when something of your own class cannot be accessed then what is the use of it


//‚≠ê‚≠ê CHILD CLASS CANNOT CREATE A PARENT CLASS but PARENT CLASS CAN CREATE CHILD CLASS(logically)
